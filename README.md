# How to install

The game consists of a single jar file by the name AM40.jar. It can be found in /shade directory after building the project with Maven.
This file can launch both the Server and the Client (CLI or GUI can be selected in the starting phase)

To run the server, use the command:
java -jar AM40.jar --server

To run the client, use the command:
java -jar AM40.jar --client

from the command line in the jar's folder. 
You can't use the windows' jar generated file in linux and viceversa. The jar must be regenerated.

Supported in Windows and Linux.

For macOS you have to change the settings of the screen, to do it just follow the instructions in the comments in the method [newScene](https://github.com/Digioref/IS23-AM40/blob/main/src/main/java/it/polimi/ingsw/am40/GUI/Viewer.java) starting at line 378.
